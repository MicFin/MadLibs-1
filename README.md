The MadLib of J. Alfred Prufrock
=======

On the first day of General Assembly Web Development Immersive, we were assigned to read chapters of Programming Ruby: The Pragmatic Programmer's Guide, that talk about methods on arrays and hashes, and iterators.  

On my second day, we were assigned the task of making a madlib to practice string interpolation.  

I started working on a second version of my madlib program to practice using the methods on arrays and hashes.  I'm practicing keeping my work in multiple files and using `require` to import the text into my file, and I'm hoping to export the results of the madlib to a text file so I can keep the results.

Future features I'd like to add:
  
  * deal with pairs of rhyming words like ['peach', 'beach'], maybe using hashes inside of hashes or arrays inside of arrays.
  * make madlib methods that I can use again on other poems, automating as many of the repetitive tasks as possible
  * practice writing automated testing code that tests my code as I make it
  * start saving data about which words are nouns and which words are verbs in some kind of data repository such that I can eventually have a big list of user-created nouns and the madlib can start generating itself without additional input, or recycling words that originally got replaced from this text into another one.
  * figure out how to make a website where people can generate their own madlibs and contribute their noun-verb-adjective data to my lists.
